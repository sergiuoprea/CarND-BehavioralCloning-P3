This network will just going to be a flattened image connected to a single output node. This single output node will predict the stearing angle, thus converting this model into a regression network. In contrast with a classification network, we may apply a softmax activation function to the output layer. Nevertheless in this case we will not use an activation function. We will directly predict the steering measurement. \n",
